# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was developed to assist a biological researcher in a prominate biological laboratory. The hypothisis is to discover bacteria that have the ability to synthesis protiens to taste like beef. They have partnered with a food startup Improbable Beef to research candidate species. While fungi, algae, and microorganisims found in plant roots have show promise . The proper bacteria is ellusive for deterimining the very best beef subsitute. Bacteria on the human body could be a possible source. Specifically the bacteria found in the belly button. The dataset hase been created to secure the test subjects identities.
## Resources
To build this project the following resources were used: VS Code version 1.62.3, Notepadd ++, v8.1.9, HTML, Chrome Browser verision 96.0.4664.45, JavaScript ES9, D3, and Bootstrap.
## Results
Ploty and Java script were used to create the final page. 

An image was added to the jumbotron and can be seen here:

A summary analysis was added below the jumbotron.

Finally the page was made mobile friendly, here is the example:

Elements that were needed for the analysis were  the ability to change the test subject ID and get the dempgraphic information populated

A bar chart representing the top 10 bacteria.

 A bubble chart was needed to represent all of the bacteria. This chart was in the colorscale = Earth

 A gauge was added to highlight the frequency of washing by the test subject.

## Summary
Overall a very challenging analysis. Very heavy on frontend delivery. Future improvments would be to add navigation bars to the page to assist in navigating when on smaller devices. A background color scheme could be added.
